Waste2Taste üç≤
Waste2Taste is a full-stack web application designed to combat food waste by connecting food donors with those in need. Built with a Flask backend and a dynamic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, this platform allows users to post surplus food items, which can then be viewed and claimed by others in the community.

‚ú® Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Role-Based Access Control: Distinct roles for Donors (who can create posts) and Receivers (who can claim posts).

Food Posting: Donors can create detailed posts for surplus food, including descriptions, quantity, location, and an expiry time.

View & Claim: Users can browse all available (unclaimed and unexpired) food posts. Logged-in users can claim an item with a single click.

Donor Dashboard: A personal dashboard for donors to view the status of their posts (Available/Claimed) and delete them.

Receiver Dashboard: A personal dashboard for receivers to view a history of all the items they have successfully claimed.

Automated Cleanup: A background scheduler automatically removes posts from the database once they have expired.

User Profiles: Users can add and update additional profile information like their full name and default location.
